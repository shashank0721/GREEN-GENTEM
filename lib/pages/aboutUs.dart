The TUBAF translates to "University of Mines" and is the oldest running mining and metallurgical university in the world. TUBAF is a resource university located in the Saxony area (~ 40 km from Dresden). The Empower program was started in 2018 by the Graduate and Research Academy (GraFa), TUBAF, to encourage and nurture international Ph.D. candidates in developing social entrepreneurship. During this program, together with experts, we have developed strong skills in governance, management and entrepreneurship, which laid a solid foundation for Green Gentem.',

Recycling can help to build us this sustainable environment. Because when we recycle a commodity, the old item is not wasted, and new resources are not used, which helps us in many ways. For example, it saves energy, decreases waste production, preserves resources, and will further help reduce global warming, pollution, and health hazards. And if we want to recycle healthily, we need proper infrastructure, the latest statistics, efficient recycling technologies, and an intelligent supply chain. And we at Green Gentem are focused on our main objective to make the environment more sustainable. So come on, let\'s make the change together',
